# Crypto-Chat-dApp
Crypto Chat dApp was build for Moralis Weekly Challenge 1.
Where we had to build real-time chatting dApp in less than a week.

My Crypto Chatting dApp has:
- user can connect with MetaMask or WalletConnect
- how to use instructions
- changeble username and profile picture
- user can check his/hers balances on website itself
- user can buy crypto with fiat on website itself
- everyone can create a chat group and set restrictions to it (how much of a specific ERC-20 token or ERC-721 or ERC-1155 user must hold to start chatting)
- every group has name, image and description
- it is also cross-chain (eth mainnet, bsc mainnet, testnets)
- real time chatting
